## Describing the dynamics of plasma in the boundary between the atmosphere and space
- **Region in the Atmosphere:** The ionosphere
- **Goal:** Develop a tool to help heliophysicists investigate how the boundary between the ionosphere responds to changes in the sun
- **Adviser and Institution:** [Dr. Fabiano Rodrigues](https://sites.google.com/site/rodrigueslab/), UTD
- **Current Involvement:** I am presently working with Dr. Rodrigues to collect the results of a model we developed into a paper. We will share an open-source version of the model for the heliophysics community to utilize

## Observing and Modeling Planet-Formation in a Distant Galaxy
- **Region in Space:** The Small Magellanic Cloud
- **Goal:** Characterize planet-formation in a galaxy with an abundance of heavy elements similar to the early Universe
- **Adviser and Institution:** [Dr. Luke Keller](https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/lkeller), Ithaca College
- **Contributions:** I wrote a data-analysis pipeline in Python, the results of which were presented in competitive observation-time proposals at research telescopes

## Dark Matter in an Unusual Merging Galaxy Cluster
- **Region in Space:** Abell 2146, a colossal system comprised of two merging galaxy clusters
- **Goal:** Identify images of distant galaxies created by the strong gravitational influence of dark matter
- **Adviser and Institution:** [Dr. Lindsay King](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/lindsay.king), UT Dallas, at the Maria Mitchell Observatory NSF-REU Internship in Astronomy
- **Contributions:** I identified three new strongly lensed galaxies
