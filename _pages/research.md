## Observing and Modeling Planet-Formation in a Distant Galaxy
- **Region in Space:** The Small Magellanic Cloud
- **Goal:** Characterize the processes of planet-formation in a galaxy with an abundance of heavy elements similar to the early Universe
- **Data and Analysis:** Near-infrared spectra obtained with a spectrograph, photo-ionization models, Python routines to perform spectroscopy
