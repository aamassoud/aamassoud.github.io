Below is a brief overview of the research I have completed toward my dissertation. Please see my Curriculum Vitae for a detailed list of publications.

## Ground-based observations of the upper atmosphere and space environment near Earth
- **Region in the atmosphere:** The ionosphere
- **Goal:** Develop a tool to help heliophysicists investigate how the ionosphere responds to changes in the sun
- **Adviser and institution:** [Dr. Fabiano Rodrigues](https://labs.utdallas.edu/rodrigues/), UTD
- **Selected publication:** Massoud et al. (2024), [First climatology of F-region UHF echoes observed by the AMISR-14 system at the Jicamarca radio observatory and comparison with the climatology of VHF echoes observed by the collocated JULIA radar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682624001561), Journal Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 263, doi:10.1016/j.jastp.2024.106328.
