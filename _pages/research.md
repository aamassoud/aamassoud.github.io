## Observing and Modeling Planet-Formation in a Distant Galaxy
- **Region in Space:** The Small Magellanic Cloud
- **Goal:** Characterize planet-formation in a galaxy with an abundance of heavy elements similar to the early Universe
- **Adviser and Institution:** [Dr. Luke Keller](https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/lkeller), Ithaca College
- **Current Involvement:** I am writing a data-analysis pipeline in Python. The results of this pipeline will be prepared for publication and presented in competitive observation proposals

## Dark Matter in an Unusual Merging Galaxy Cluster
- **Region in Space:** Abell 2146, a colossal system comprised of two merging galaxy clusters
- **Goal:** Identify images of distant galaxies created by the strong gravitational influence of dark matter
- **Adviser and Institution:** [Dr. Lindsay King](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/lindsay.king), UT Dallas, at the Maria Mitchell Observatory NSF-REU Internship in Astronomy
- **Current Involvement:** Material is being prepared for a paper on Abell 2146 with me as a co-author
