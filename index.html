<p>
  I am an early career astronomer currently conducting post-baccalaureate research at Ithaca College.
  I am also a 2020 alumnus of Ithaca College and have expanded my undergraduate thesis-work while applying to graduate programs in astronomy.
  For my research, I analyze spectra from stars in combination with computational models to determine the processes by which planets form in other galaxies.
  Using my personal background and perspective, I energize myself to pursue challenging opportunities and make astronomy a more accessible discipline.
