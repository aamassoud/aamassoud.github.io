<p>
  I am a research assistant in the PhD in Physics program at the University of Texas at Dallas.
  I am also a 2020 alumnus of Ithaca College where I earned a B.A. in Physics.
  I model the dynamics of the low-latitude ionosphere to describe the physics that drives diurnal and seasonal changes in the boundary between the atmosphere and space.
  Drawing on my personal background and perspective, I energize myself to pursue challenging opportunities where I can learn from others.
